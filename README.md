# **Discourse Hide Lock Icon**

This theme component is largely inspired by [Discourse Hide Lock Badge Icon](https://github.com/Lillinator/hide-lock-badge-icon/) but instead it hides the lock icons completely. It is also compatible with the 
[Discourse Category Jumbotron](https://github.com/ICIJ/discourse-category-jumbotron) theme component.
